# edgy-color-generator

This is not really a **color-generator** rather, this is something like theme building tool for [edgy](https://github.com/LaineZ/edgy) UI library. with cool color picker that REALLY works in Rgb565 format, not just maps your beautiful 24-bit color into 16-bit. It runs real edgy UI-context directly in your browser (you can play with UI!)
If you're tired of inaccurate conversions and want true 16-bit precision, this tool is for you.

**This tool is in early development (I just backed up a WASM template, lol).
Expect bugs, missing features, and an absurd amount of TODOs.**

# Features (in the future)

* True RGB565 Color picker – Other web-based color pickers shows a color in 24bit, on real 16-bit pallete it look more smuggish
* Real-Time UI Preview – Run the edgy UI library in WASM and tweak the theme live.
* Export your theme and integrate it into your edgy projects.
